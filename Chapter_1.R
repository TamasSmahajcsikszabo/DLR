# In classical programming, the paradigm of symbolic AI, 
# humans input rules (a program) and data to be processed 
# according to these rules, and out come answers 

# With machine learning, humans input data as well as the 
# answers expected from the data, and out come the rules. 
# These rules can then be applied to new data to produce
# original answers. 

# The central problem in machine learning and deep learning 
# is to meaningfully transform data: in other words, to learn 
# useful representations of the input data at 
# handâ€”representations that get us closer to the expected
# output. 

# Learning, in the context of machine learning, describes 
# an automatic search process for better representations.
